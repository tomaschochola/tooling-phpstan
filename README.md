# PHP Tooling: PHPStan Configuration

This package enforces the highest level of static analysis available for the PHP runtime. It is configured to operate at the maximum strictness level, effectively treating PHP as a strictly typed compiled language by rejecting `mixed` types, implicit casts, and potential runtime null pointer exceptions during the build phase.

The configuration includes a curated set of strict rules and bleeding-edge extensions that prohibit loose comparisons and unsafe architectural patterns. It serves as the first line of defense in the quality assurance pipeline, ensuring that technical debt cannot accumulate within the codebase.

## Critical Infrastructure Grade

This software functions as the **Alpine Linux of the application layer**.

It serves as a hardened architectural primitive, designed on the same principles as minimal, security-focused operating systems—zero excess, absolute predictability, and a minimized attack surface.

It is engineered specifically for **mission critical environments** where resource efficiency and correctness are the primary constraints. This component is not a general purpose utility but a specialized instrument for architects building high availability systems that demand deterministic behavior under extreme load.

## The Engineering Doctrine

This software adheres to a strict set of immutable laws designed to guarantee system stability and correctness. These axioms define the "Tomáš Chochola" engineering standard.

### Defensive Posture

Trust no one. Every input is validated. Every return value is verified. The system assumes hostility and incompetence from the outside world and guards against it at every boundary.

### Immediate Termination

Fail fast and fail loud. Silent error suppression is strictly prohibited. If an anomaly is detected the process must terminate immediately to prevent state corruption.

### Absolute Type Safety

The runtime is treated as a strictly typed environment. We enforce the maximum level of static analysis. Mixed types, implicit casting, and ambiguous signatures are architectural violations.

### Singular Execution Path

There is exactly one way to perform any given action. Magic methods, overloading, and "syntactic sugar" that obscure the execution flow are rejected in favor of explicit deterministic logic.

### Zero Dependency

We rely on the standard library. External dependencies are introduced only when they provide a validated cryptographic or architectural necessity that cannot be efficiently implemented natively.

## The Ecosystem

This repository is a component of a comprehensive architectural ecosystem designed for immediate production deployment. It integrates the following pillars into a unified operational standard.

### Production Grade Runtimes

All components are pre-configured for high-load production environments utilizing optimized Docker images and strict security.

### Unified Tooling Standards

Quality is enforced globally through centralized configurations for PHPStan, PHP-CS-Fixer, ESLint, and Prettier ensuring every line of code adheres to the same rigorous strictness.

### Infrastructure as Code

Projects are delivered with complete DevSecOps configurations including local development via DevContainers and production orchestration via Docker Swarm.

### Automated Observability

The architecture anticipates automation with standardized workflows for continuous integration and OTLP-ready structured logging.
